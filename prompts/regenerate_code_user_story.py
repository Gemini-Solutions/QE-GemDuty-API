CHANGE_TYPE_ROUTER="""
Assume there is a feature file, a step definition and a implementation file for testing a particular scenario, your task is to categorize the instructions in any of the following categories:
1. All: If the instruction has an addition of a new step in the feature file which hence forth requires changes to be done in the step definition and implementation file.
2. Only Feature: If the instruction require changes in the feature file but not in the implementation file and step definition file. For example, adding a new example in the feature file.

The instructions to be categorized are given below the markers `---START-INSTRUCTIONS---` and `---END-INSTRUCTIONS---`.
---START-INSTRUCTIONS---
{instructions}
---END-INSTRUCTIONS---

Important points to note:
1. The output should be a JSON for the following format:
{{
"category" : <All or Only feature>
"justification" : <justification for the category>
}}
2. Return only the JSON and nothing else.

You can use the following examples for clarity:
Category: All
(New step added in the feature file, requiring updates to step definitions and implementation)

Instruction: "Add a step to validate the error message when the user enters an invalid password."
    Feature File: Add Then an "Invalid password" error should appear.
    Step Definition: Add a regex-matching function for the new step.
    Implementation: Write code to check the error message.
Output:
{{
  "category": "All",
  "justification": "Adding new step 'Then an \"Invalid password\" error should appear' requires corresponding step definition and implementation code to validate error messages"
}}

Instruction: "Include a step to navigate to the settings page before submitting the form."
    Feature File: Add Given I am on the settings page.
    Step Definition/Implementation: Define navigation logic and link it to the step.
Output:
{{
  "category": "All",
  "justification": "New navigation step 'Given I am on the settings page' needs step definition mapping and implementation logic for page navigation"
}}

Instruction: "Verify the total cart price after applying a discount coupon."
    Feature File: Add Then the total price should reflect a 10  discount.
    Step Definition/Implementation: Implement discount calculation and assertion.
Output:
{{
  "category": "All",
  "justification": "Verification step for discount calculation requires new assertion logic in implementation file and step definition pattern update"
}}

Instruction: "Add a step to upload a profile picture during registration."
    Feature File: Add When I upload "profile.jpg" as my profile picture.
    Step Definition/Implementation: Handle file upload logic.
Output:
{{
  "category": "All",
  "justification": "File upload step 'When I upload \"profile.jpg\"...' needs new file handling implementation and step definition regex"
}}

Instruction: "Check if the userâ€™s account is locked after 3 failed login attempts."
    Feature File: Add Then the account should be locked.
    Step Definition/Implementation: Implement account-lock validation.
Output:
{{
  "category": "All",
  "justification": "Account lock verification requires new validation logic in implementation and step definition for the assertion"
}}

Category: Only Feature
(Changes limited to the feature file)

Instruction: "Add a new example to test login with a non-registered email."
    Feature File: Add a new row under Examples: with test@example.com and Password123.
Output:
{{
  "category": "Only Feature",
  "justification": "Adding new example row uses existing steps/patterns and requires no code changes"
}}

Instruction: "Update the existing scenario to include a tag @smoke."
    Feature File: Add @smoke above the scenario name.
Output:
{{
  "category": "Only Feature",
  "justification": "Adding @smoke tag is metadata change that doesn't affect step definitions or implementation"
}}

Instruction: "Rename the scenario from 'Successful Login' to 'User Login with Valid Credentials'."
    Feature File: Update the scenario title only.
Output:
{{
  "category": "Only Feature",
  "justification": "Scenario renaming only affects feature file structure without changing step logic"
}}
Instruction: "Add a new scenario outline to test checkout with different payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal)."
    Feature File: Add a new Scenario Outline with Examples for payment methods (no new steps).
Output:
{{
  "category": "Only Feature",
  "justification": "New scenario outline with payment methods uses existing steps with different examples"
}}

You can use the following instructions to regenerate the user story based on the instructions given to you.
1. Go through the instructions and identify the changes that need to be made in the user story.
2. Update the user story with the changes based on the instructions.
3. if a URL is present in the instruction then add it to the appropriate place prefixing the same with `redirect to : <URL mentioned in the instructions>`

Important instructions:
1. While updating the user story as per the instructions maintain the old instructions already present in the user story
2. Do not return anything other than the regenerated user story.
